## Installation

To run the project you simply have to:
1. Clone this repository.
2. ***Get*** the Flutter packages using:
```console
$ flutter pub get
```
3. Launch the application on an emulator or real device.

## Architecture

For this project ***Clean Architecture*** was used, which allows to make the code as clean as possible, for this there are many good practices that include how variables are named, how we build functions, abstraction of objects and structures, etc. All this allows the code to be much more understandable, have greater scalability and abstraction between the different modules. The folder structure used was:

</p>

Where:
- **data:** Has everything related to external services and repositories.
- **domain:** Has everything related to bussiness logic and state management.
- **ui:** Has everything related to __Flutter__ code, all the __User Interface__.

Within each top-level folder are more subdivided folders that provide compartmentalization, modularity, and project abstraction.

### State Management

In addition to Clean Architecture, the level of abstraction was increased using __State Management__ using the **GetX** package, allowing data to be handled without complications and maintaining consistency between screens.

### Cache

To implement the cache, the **Sqflite** package was used, a __local relational database__ that allows executing queries and operations based on __SQLite__.

In order to demonstrate the difference between the behavior of cached data and no cached data, I proceeded to establish persistence for the **Post** objects ***only***, while the other objects (Comments and Users) **do not** have disk cache.

### Unit Testing

The unit tests implemented evaluate each one of the managers developed, checking that the interaction with each one of the **GetControllers** (State Management) is correct.
